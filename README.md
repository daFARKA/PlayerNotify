# Player Notify

Player Notify is a fabric minecraft 1.21.3 client-side mod, that notifies the user, when a specific player is in a certain range. 
The user can add, remove, clear and see the list of players that are being targeted, using the following commands:

```
/pn_add <player_name>
```

```
/pn_remove <player_name>
```

```
/pn_clear
```

```
/pn_list
```

The user is also notified when a targeted player joins or disconnects from the server. 
Be aware that the mod does NOT notify you when you have joined and targets are online.
